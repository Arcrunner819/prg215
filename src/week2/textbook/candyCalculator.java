/** use the Harris-Benedict equation to estimate the number of calories your body needs to maintain your weight
if you do no exercise. And this is called your basal metabolic rate, or BMR. And here are two different formulas one for males:

BMR = 66+(6.3 weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years) 
 
ere is the formula for the number of calories you need to ingest to maintain your weight, and it’s based on your current weight 
in pounds, height in inches, age in years; and a similar formula for males, but with different numbers, here:

BMR = 655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)
